<h2>What does this service do?</h2>
	
<p>
	It checks your web page for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/">RDFa</a>
	and displays any data found there. It also compares your data against the published
	recommendations from major consumers/users of RDFa data, to see how well your
	data matches their requirements.
</p>

<p>
	If your page doesn't raise any errors or warnings, it doesn't mean that your data is
	perfect&nbsp;&#8212; it just means that your errors may have been too ingenious
	for an automated tool to detect!!
</p>

<h2>Your service says my page is fine, but Google/Facebook/whatever can't see my data!</h2>

<p>
	Some services may have accidental or intentional deviations from the RDFa 
	standard in their parsers. This service does not attempt to replicate such bugs;
	nor can it, because I don't have insider information about how Google/Facebook/whatever
	parses RDFa.
</p>

<p>
	This service simply parses RDFa according to the W3C recommendations and
	compares the end result to the schemas accepted by major consumers.
</p>

<h2>What's all this "widget://" stuff?</h2>

<p>
	RDFa allows authors to include relative links in their HTML, like <code>&lt;a rel="next"
	href="page2">next&lt;/a></code>. If you use the file upload or code pasting facilities on
	this RDFa checker, then, for the purposes of resolving relative links, the service assumes that
	your document's base URL is something like <code>widget://blahblahblah.rdfa/self</code>
	in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
</p>

<p>
	If you're checking a web page by typing in its address or clicking on a link, then you should
	never see this stuff.
</p>

<h2>My page used to have no errors, but now it has lots!</h2>

<p>That's because we're adding extra checks all the time!</p>

<h2>Your pages should be valid XHTML!</h2>

<p>This service publishes valid XHTML5+RDFa and HTML5+RDFa. Most
pages content-negotiate between the two. Some pages are also available in JSON
via content-negotiation.</p>
